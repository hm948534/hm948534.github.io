## Our Goal

Imagine a world without female doctors, scientists, lawyers, mathematicians, authors, etc. The female population adds so much contribution to all areas of study and careers and have for so many years. Growing up, I learned about the numerous accomplishments of men, but hardly any women. This led me along with many other young girls to feel as though our minds were inferior. Our goal is bring more awareness to female history and teach young women that they are capable of greatness and exhibit the amazing possibilities when men and women work together. I want young girls to grow up with just as many academic role models as there are entertainment role models. 

I believe I have a contribution to make to a larger discussion because I want young girls in future generations to grow up watching women succeed in any field they aspire to be in. I want all of you to feel inspired to change the cirriculum of schools of schools to be to be beneficial for both boys and girls. When both are taught that they are able to succeed, they can grow up learning how to work together and change the world one day.
