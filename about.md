## Our Goal

Imagine a world without female doctors, scientists, lawyers, mathematicians, authors, etc. The female population adds so much contribution to all areas of study and careers and have for so many years. Growing up, I learned about the numerous accomplishments of men, but hardly any women. This led me along with many other young girls to feel as though our minds were inferior. Our goal is bring more awareness to female history and teach young women that they are capable of greatness and exhibit the amazing possibilities when men and women work together. I want young girls to grow up with just as many academic role models as there are entertainment role models.
